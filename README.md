ChatIO is a realtime chatting application that uses Firestore Firebase to store the data of the users and their messages, then sends the messages to the user based on the user id, sender and receiver.

The chat has a LoginActivity, RegisterActivity, MainActivity, ChatActivity and a UsersActivity. For the implementation of this application I have used applications and concepts such as Figma for an initial design, Android Studio as the IDE of choice, Java, Kotlin, Firestore for the data and XML.

Here are some screenshots of the application running.
